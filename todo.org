** TODO Build my own lapwing theory & dictionaries.
There will be some dictionaries disagreement I have with official lapwing dicts, I need to make sure they are helping me build better dictionary instead of creating more collisions
*** some words I have question with
- instead  STPHED
- question  KWE
- earlier KWHERL
*** some other briefs, not a instinct translation
- and SKP  (this one has APBD available)
*** TODO Ideas to make lapwings theory better.
for each pronoun there are suffixes like âˆ’s, -self etc. They can be uniformed by suffix like *Z for ..s (hers HER*Z) and *S for ..self(ves) (ourselves O*URS)
TODO build the list
- [ ] -s can have *Z (yours ours...)
- [ ] -self -selves can have *S(yourself sourselves)
- [ ] -ther can have *RT (neither either rather ...)
  *others* is a special word for rules above
- [ ] -thing can have *GT (thing, everything ...)
- [ ] -body can have -BD? (everybody, somebody?)
- [ ] *ae*, *a*e .. can be forced by using 'AE' most
